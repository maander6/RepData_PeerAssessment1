# Reproducible Research: Peer Assessment 1
##Submitted by maander6, Thu Jul 16 19:45:03 2015
Data  (activity.csv) for this analysis is provided by the Reproducible Research 
Coursera Course Instructors.  It is placed in the working directory for the 
analysis.

## Loading and preprocessing the data

Libraries dplyr and ggplot2 are required for the analysis


```r
  library(dplyr)
```

```
## 
## Attaching package: 'dplyr'
## 
## The following object is masked from 'package:stats':
## 
##     filter
## 
## The following objects are masked from 'package:base':
## 
##     intersect, setdiff, setequal, union
```

```r
  library(ggplot2)
```

```
## Warning: package 'ggplot2' was built under R version 3.1.3
```

Data is loaded using the read.csv() function, and then converted to a table.
The type of data in each column is converted to date format or numeric
format to allow for subsequent processing


```r
  temp <- read.csv("activity.csv")
  data <- tbl_df(temp)
  data$date <- as.Date(data$date, "%Y-%m-%d")
  data$steps <- as.numeric(data$steps)
```


## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?

```r
  df <- subset(data, !is.na(data$steps))
  avg.step <- df %>% group_by(date) %>% summarize(total=sum(steps))
  avg <- mean(avg.step$total)
  mdn <- median(avg.step$total)
```

The mean number of steps taken is 10766.19 and the median number of steps each 
day is 10765

A Histogram is created to display the distribution of total steps taken on any given
day from October and November of 2012.  The data is binned in groups of 
1000 steps, and the histogram has the mean of the daily steps superimposed with the 
vertical black line.


```r
  qplot(avg.step$total, binwidth=1000, fill="red") + 
          geom_vline(xintercept=avg, color="black") +
          xlab("Number of Steps") +
          ylab("Frequency")
```

## What is the average daily activity pattern?
Grouping the activity data by the interval allows the analysis to evaluate the
average activity pattern throughout the day.  This pattern for October and 
November is show in the following line graph.


```r
  avg.interval <- df %>% group_by(interval) %>% summarize(avg = mean(steps),
     stdev = sd(steps))
  qplot(avg.interval$interval, avg.interval$avg, data=avg.interval, geom="line") +
    xlab("Daily Interval, minutes") +
    ylab("Average Steps")
```

![](./PA1_template_files/figure-html/Daily_Activity_Pattern-1.png) 

From this data, the interval with the highest daily activity can be determined.


```r
   maxint <- avg.interval$interval[which(avg.interval$avg == max(avg.interval$avg))]
   maxint
```

```
## [1] 835
```
The interval with the highest average activity (measured in steps) is at
835 minutes.

## Imputing missing values
In this section the the number of missing values in the activity data set is
calculated and the missing values are replaced.  The missing values are replaced
by generating a random number from a normal distribution calculated using the
mean and standard deviation of the number of steps for that interval calculated 
previously.  If the random number generated by the normal distribution is
negative, a value of 0 steps is recorded for that interval.


```r
  df.missing <- subset(data, is.na(data$steps))
  missing <- nrow(df.missing)
```

There are 2304 missing values in the activity data set.


```r
  impute <- function(df, df1){
    num <- nrow(df1)
    for (i in 1:num){
      val <- round(rnorm(1, df1$avg[i], df1$stdev[i]))
      if (val < 0){
        val <- 0
      } 
    df$steps[which(df$interval == df1$interval[i])] <- val
  }
  df
}
  
  df.replaced <- impute(df.missing, avg.interval)
  data1 <- arrange(rbind(df, df.replaced), date, interval)
  data1
```

```

```r
  avg.step.cor <- data1 %>% group_by(date) %>% summarize(total=sum(steps))
  avg1 <- mean(avg.step.cor$total)
  mdn1 <- median(avg.step.cor$total)
```

After imputing the data set to add values where NA had previously been reported,
it is found that the average daily activity is 11425.57, and the median 
daily activity is 11458.  Not unexpectedly, since we added steps to
to the activity data set, the average daily activity increased by 659.3851,
and the median daily activity increased by 693.


```r
  qplot(avg.step.cor$total, binwidth=1000) + 
          geom_vline(xintercept=avg1, color="black") +
          geom_vline(xintercept=mdn1, color="red") +
          xlab("Number of Steps") +
          ylab("Frequency")
```

## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
Using the weekday() function, the day of the week can be added to the activity data.


```r
  dayofweek <- weekdays(data1$date)
  data1 <- cbind(data1, dayofweek)
```

Using this data, we can subset the activity data based on weekday or weekend.
This allows one to compare the daily activity at 5-minute intervals to see if
there are differences in the activity pattern for weekdays and weekend days.


```r
  weekday <- subset(data1, data1$dayofweek != c("Saturday", "Sunday"))
  weekend <- subset(data1, data1$dayofweek == c("Saturday", "Sunday"))
```
